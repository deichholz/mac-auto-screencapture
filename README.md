Capture multiple screens in automated mac screenshot. 

Currently, it's just roughed out functionality. The individual screenshots are combined using imagemagick, so they are stretched/padded to fit.

== Critical ToDos ==
* handle switch between 1 and multiple screens.
* resample images before stitching them.

== Ideas to explore ==
* adding some sort of timeline browse feature...
